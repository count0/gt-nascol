    "\n",
    "These are some of the functionalities of `graph-tool` which are currently not available in most other comparable packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Comprehensive framework for [inferential community detection](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/demos/inference/inference.html#inference-howto), build upon statistically principled approaches that avoid overfitting and are interpretable. (See [here](https://skewed.de/tiago/posts/modularity-harmful) for why you should avoid off-the-shelf methods available in other software packages.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Support for [network reconstruction from dynamics](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/demos/reconstruction_indirect/reconstruction.html).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  Support for [uncertainty quantification](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/demos/reconstruction_direct/reconstruction.html) in network data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Support for [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) shared memory [parallelism](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/parallel.html) for several algorithms.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  High-quality [network visualization](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/draw.html#draw), both static and interactive, supporting [animations](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/demos/animation/animation.html#animation) and [matplotlib integration](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/demos/matplotlib/matplotlib.html#matplotlib-sec).\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.  [Filtered graphs](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/quickstart.html#sec-graph-filtering), i.e. graphs where nodes and edges are temporarily masked. These are first class citizens in the library, and are accepted by every function. Due to the use C++ template metaprogramming, this functionality comes at no performance cost when filtering is not being used.\n",

    "    \n",
    "8.  Integration with the [Netzschleuder](https://networks.skewed.de) network data repository, enabling [easy loading](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/collection.html#graph_tool.collection.ns) of network data.\n",

    "### Installing graph-tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to install graph-tool is via [conda](https://www.anaconda.com):\n",

    "conda create --name gt -c conda-forge graph-tool\n",
    "conda activate gt\n",
    "```\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "If you install ``graph_tool`` via conda it will install binaries that are optimized for your specific CPU micro-architecture, including SIMD vectorization, in addition to having OpenMP enabled for parellization.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other [installation methods](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/installation.html) are possible. *Unfortunatelly, you cannot install via pip.*\n",
    "\n",
